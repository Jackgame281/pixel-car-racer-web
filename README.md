Web Port of Pixel Car Racer, an old Android game


# mini q&a
Q: Why port this?
A: It's an old game, and I feel like some people should be able to run this on their computer.

Q: Can I contribute to this?
A: Absolutely! So far, this is only a one-man project with help from AI (unfortanately) and I could absolutely use the help!

Q: Is there a project map? 
A: Yes, it'll be published when I can easily write it out.
