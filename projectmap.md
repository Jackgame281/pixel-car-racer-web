Proof of Concept, somewhat working

* Engine sounds (current ones are working but aren't good)
* Parts system (rims, bumpers, etc.)
* Spray-paint system
* AI racers
* export data, save progress or move between computers
* crates (can house parts, spraypaint colors, or cash)
* ~~Music~~ (implemented 10/8/25)

likely never happening:
* online racing/connectivity
* multiplayer (local or online)
* facebook/google play APIs
